					<p> As an engineering intern I assist senior engineers with various substation design projects: 12.4KV - 345KV. This includes: drafting through the use of MicroStation/AutoCAD as well as markups for one-line diagrams and schematics with Bluebeam. As an intern, high priority is placed on complying with documentation and QA/QC standards.  An example project I am involved with is the design of an inter-substation fiber optic network. </p>

					<p> As a Radon Mitigation Technician, I installed over 300 radon mitigation systems in accordance with architectural drawings. As a technician, I operated independantly by managing daily work orders, scheduling and vehicle maintenance. Each system was installed adherant to radon standards and constructed along OSHA guidelines. Installations were carefully coordinated with contractors, project managers and customers to minimize change-orders and interferance with other sub-systems.  </p>

					<p> As an electrical apprentice, I		installed single phase electrical systems, data networks and low voltage systems in both residential and commercial projects. This includes both new construction, remodel and troubleshooting applications. To accomplish this, I translated blueprints, circuit diagrams and  schematics into effective systems.  As an apprentice I placed high priority on designing NEC compliant systems that were simple, clean and easily expandable.</p>
